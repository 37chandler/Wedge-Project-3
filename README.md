# Wedge-Project
Advanced Data Analytics
This project shows the uploading of multiple CSV files to Google Big query by using Pandas (task 1 file). The next task is pulling information for 80 random store customers and saving it to a local file for analysis. It also uses pandas and connects to Big Query (Task 2). Finally, the third task is creating a SQL database that is small enough for local usage by connecting to big query and only pulling the needed information and saving it locally.
